    Project A14 is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed to deliver the latest news from UNC Charlotte for the month. The application leverages a modern tech stack to ensure fast, responsive, and interactive user experiences. The backend is built with NodeJS, providing a scalable and efficient server-side solution. NodeJS's non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture make it ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously, which is crucial for a news delivery platform expecting high traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the frontend, the application utilizes Angular. This framework supports dynamic content updates essential for a news SPA, allowing for seamless content refreshes without reloading the entire page. Angular's robust data-binding capabilities ensure that the latest news is consistently presented to the user in real-time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data is managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB's schema-less nature allows for the storage of diverse news content in various formats, making it easy to update and retrieve data as the news evolves. This database choice complements the real-time, dynamic nature of the news application by facilitating rapid queries and updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, this tech stack provides a solid foundation for Project A14, supporting its goal to deliver timely and engaging news updates to the UNC Charlotte community. This infrastructure ensures that the application is not only robust and responsive but also capable of scaling to meet future demands as the user base grows.
